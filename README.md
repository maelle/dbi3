The goal of this repository is to design a new database interface from scratch, based on the lessons learned from DBI and the previous R Consortium projects.
In the beginning, the issue tracker will be used to collect and categorize issues that did not fit the scope of {DBI} or related packages.
Eventually, the repository will contain a working package and a design document.
